# montecarlo
A python3 library to run and analyze simple Monte Carlo routines. Some basic text output summary and plotting (via matplotlib) functionality is included

**montecarlo.py:** main Monte Carlo functionality
  * class MonteCarlo: Used to run, score, and analyze a Monte Carlo routine that scores a *single* value
  * class MultiMonteCarlo: Used to run, score, and analyze a Monte Carlo routine that scores *multiple* values

**example1.py:** basic example shows how to run a Monte Carlo simulation of the output of a random number generator

**pi_example.py:** example estimation of the value of pi by 'throwing darts' randomly at a circle

This is my first project hosted to GitHub. So rest easy knowing I have very little idea what I am doing
